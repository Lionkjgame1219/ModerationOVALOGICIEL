"""functions for communicating with an A2S port.

A2S is a valve protocol for requesting information about a game server such as the
current map, number of players, and max number of players. This port is usually
UDP/7071 for chivalry 2. Chivalry 2 only implements A2S_INFO and A2S_PING,
so only those are implemented here.

See the A2S_INFO class documentation to see what kind of useful information can be
returned here.
